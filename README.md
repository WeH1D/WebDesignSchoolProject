# WebDesignSchoolProject

A school project done as a part of the 'basics of web development and design' course. 

This was a project I did when I started learning about web design/development. I was especially proud of the bookmark style menu selection I did only using pure css and js. It was a great project where I discovered I quite enjoy web design. 

It might not be the most beautiful thing you ever saw, but it holds a special place with me as a first project I did on my own.
